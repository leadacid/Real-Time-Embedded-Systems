The stripetest should XOR encode the file into chunks and the read it back, recovering data
from any lost chunk if necessary, but only 1 in the worst case.

Run the demonstration as:

stripetest inputfile outputfile <sector to restore>

This code is used as a working design and proof-of-concept example.
